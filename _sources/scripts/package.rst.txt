Zeek Package
============

For Zeek scripting details, such as options, functions and events, see the auto-generated documentation:



:doc:`/scripts/__load__.zeek`

   This is the entrypoint to loading the entire package.

:doc:`/scripts/main.zeek`

   This attaches a set of predicates to all logs, and then creates a :zeek:type:`hook` for that predicate.
   The hooks get called by priority. If any hook handler breaks out of the hook, the message does not get logged.

:doc:`/scripts/local/__load__.zeek`

   Site-specific customizations go here
